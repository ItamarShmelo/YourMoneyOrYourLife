# The Second Step

This step is about tracking your "life energy". You first have to ask yourself "what is money?" is it a worthless piece of paper? Or maybe something which gets its value from this unknown entity called society? I find it best to view money as time, why? In order to make money one has to sacrafice he's (or hers's) precious time on this planet working, though it may be a job one likes (thus not necessarily a sacrafice) it still takes time.

So how much of your time it takes to create 1 NIS? On what things do you spend this time of yours?

This step is about answering the above questions.

## Step Two A

This step consists of calculating your **real** hourly wage. What do I mean by real you ask? Suppose you make a 30 NIS an hour (which is a bit above minimum) and suppose it take you an hour to get there. This adds two hours transporting yourself to your workplace each day, ten hours a week. How are you getting there? Are you using a car? If so you spend money on fuel, insurence, repaires and depreciation. If you use public tranportation how much does this cost?

Taking the above case as an example, this John Doe works for 30 NIS an hour for 40 hours a week (8 per day), in other words he makes 1200 NIS in a 40 hour work week. Adding the transportation time and cost (lets say 100 NIS a week) we realise he makes 1100 NIS in a **50** hour work week i.e a salary of 22 NIS per hour!

Your real hourly wage is then how much you make in a week minus how much **additional** money you spend on this job, if its special cloths or get aways because you need peace and quite etc. This divided by how much time you work plus how much additional time you spend on things connected to work (transportation, screaming into a pillow, crying etc) is your **real** hourly wage. 

## Step Two B 

This step consists of tracking every NIS entering and existing your life, or in the words of [the second step](#the-second-step) tracking your life energy. 

Why be so pedantic? Why every NIS? Surely this is stuiped!

This is the best way to become concious about your money, the best way to have a detailed follow-up of what happens with your life energy

## My Second Step

Unfortunately my hourly wage is currently quite low but it is about to change in the following month, I have no transit fees as a live close to work I have some bad habits but they are not connected to my job. The result of [A](#step-two-a) is calculate in [this spread sheet](Step2A.csv), the result:

$\textbf{Real-Hourly-Wage-30/1/21}=13.75\frac{\text{NIS}}{\text{hour}}$

[Step two B](#step-two-b) is done in [this spread sheet](Step2B.csv) and it will be updated on the go (currently 30/01/2021, 18:13).
