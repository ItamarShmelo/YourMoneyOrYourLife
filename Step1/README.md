# The First Step

The first step's goal is to make peace with the past. It clears the fog around one's past relationship with money.

This step consists of two substeps:

**A** : Finding how much money you have earned in your life time. 

**B** : Finding what you have to show for it, what is your net worth.

## Step One A

This step consists of calculating the sum of all the income you have ever recieved, including but not limited to:

- Salaries, from your first waitressing job at 16 to your current corporate job.
- Tax Returns and Social Security.
- Dirty money, for instance cash payments for babysitting, private tutoring, tips etc.
- Gifts, the couple hundereds you get for each birthday and your Bar Mitzvah Money.
- Loans.
- Winnings (like in the casino).
- Any illigal activity, did you steal from a cripple pregnant lady? Add it.
- Capital Gain (fancy word from investment money).
- Anything else you can think of

This step gives you the realtization that you are worth **A LOT**. It helps you forget the myths you have about earning money and gives you solid ground to start working on.
